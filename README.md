## Cadence

This application is made up of a number of scripts and API wrappers for different services. The premise is simple: our lives are complicated, and it would be nice if we could automate some of the more mundane tasks.

There are a number of services, both free and paid, which exist to fill this need, but the goal here is different. Services like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/), and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) are fantastic, and this application is not meant to replace any of them. Rather, the goal is to fill the gaps where these services are not quite enough.

### Work in Progress

This software is in a very early alpha state, and as such is not ready for use. However, feedback and input at this stage is more than welcome. I am designing this with my own needs in mind, but am trying to build it in a way that will appeal to a broader audience.
